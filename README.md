![Design preview for the Celebrity Wealth Tracker](./design/screenshot.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my mini-project!

This project utilizes the Random User Generator API and high order array methods to manipulate fake celebrities' randomly generated net worth.

**To complete this challenge, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The person name and image data utilitzed is courtesy of the Random User Generator API.**

## What I learned

This project was useful for practice working with various high order array methods. I haven't worked with sort very much in the past so I was happy to get experience with it.

```js
function sortByRichest() {
  people = people.sort((personA, personB) => {
    return personB.money - personA.money;
  });
  updateDOM();
}
```
